=== flying blind ===
I think there's something not many people have observed yet. The term "flying blind" means a lot of things but to tie it to something in my life.

When I was working I.T., flying blind meant to resolve an issue with no eyes on the problem. Sometimes due to security/privacy issues or because the user didn't know how to set-up a remote desktop session.

So with this, you flew blind. Trying to resolve an issue you simply could not see.

Make sense of something that you had to use your imagination/past experiences of numerous desktops/tickets/issues to represent.

I liken it to sort of being a doctor trying to resolve an issue for a patient that can only use describing words, kind of what they do but for computers.

It really sucks when a user doesn't know how to word or describe something. So you have to ask clarifying questions, user's dont know any better they assume because you are an I.T. analyst that you've done "flying blind" countless times or have some sort of computer remote desktop wireless osmosis.

Anyway, it works screen by screen.

Them: "So what I see is an error with the following error code: 0xblahblahblah"
Me: *Doing research on the error code* "Ok, so now tell me what you see now?"
Me: "Another screen that says blah blah blah"
And that goes for a while until we reach a resolution.

Even though they were some of the most challenging times I faced as an I.T. guy. I kind of look back fondly at them because I developed something that I still use today. Troubleshooting while flying blind.
