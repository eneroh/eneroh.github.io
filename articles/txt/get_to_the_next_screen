get_to_the_next_screen

So I've watched altered carbon s1 again recently and there was this phrase in the show that caught my attention. "Get to the next screen". Something that is ingrained in the very heart of performing testing or troubleshooting in I.T. or Cyber.

The phrase "Get to the next screen".

I liken it to finding the next set of enemies in a video game, this would point you onto your next objective.

Whenever I see an error message or whenever I see an unfamiliar prompt, the only thought running through my head is to disregard about this stupid error message. Then find what actionable steps I can take to get beyond this error to the solution... The next screen.

Typically involves a bit of research and then reviewing another GUI menu to get to the information on the error but then I have all the information required to get proceed.
