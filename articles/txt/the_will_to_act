the_will_to_act

Have you seen that movie, Batman Begins?

There's this exchange between Raas al Ghul, the antagonist and the protagonist, Bruce Wayne... It goes a little like "Your parents deaths was not your fault, it was your fathers" Raas says. Bruce responds, "I've had training" But Raas shoots this all down by simply replying with, "Your training is nothing, your will is everything. The will to act". I'm paraphrasing here but I can't help but agree with the antagonist here. I watched this movie some time ago but this idea didn't cross my mind until only recently.

What use is all the skill and training in the world if you don't utilize it?

What use is all the power or money in the world if you do not use it?

You could train for 10 years in martial arts but if you never use it to benefit yourself or those around you, what purpose did your training have?

You could be getting straight a's in school but unless you are proactive and put yourself out there, your straight a's mean naught in the real world.
