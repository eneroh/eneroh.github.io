<h2>comfort vs truth</h2>

<h3>Preface</h3>
So I've been reading a bit into philosophy recently.
<br>
<br>
<h3>C.S. Lewis - The originator</h3>
C.S. Lewis for instance. He arrived at the conclusion of: You can find comfort in truth. But with comfort, you cannot have truth and perhaps not even comfort.
<br>
<br>
<h3>Analysis</h3>
A comforting lie does not measure to a hard truth. (Not a quote by C.S. Lewis but I think this displays his conclusion nicely)
<br>
In this day and age, I am finding there is truth in this world. Even in a world filled with misinformation, propaganda and nonsense.
<br>
I can't remember where I've heard it but the phrase "People seek the truth" is ultimately wrong.
<br>
<br>
<h3>What is my interpretation of comfort?</h3>
The idea of decadence, of luxury. Embracing sloth or leisure. I think back to the phrase "Evil triumphs when good men do nothing" ~ Edmund Blake. It is my interpretation that 'lies appear when good men embrace the easy way out'. It is also not uncommon for people to think comfort and lie are synonymous in this instance, I also adhere to this idea.
<br>
<br>
Comparing the words 'comfort' and 'truth'. Truth takes effort to find typically, while with comfort it involves choosing the path of least resistence to ensure everyone is 'okay', including the comfort-sayer especially.
<br>
<br>
<h3>What does the word 'truth' mean to me?</h3>
The word 'truth' I tie to the undeniable facts. Not just belief. Someone can be fed a falsity and they can believe it as fact or true. But when I refer to truth, I mean the undeniable facts that can be observed by multiple disconnected objective parties as correct.
<br>
<br>
<h3>Truth and the masses</h3>
When I think of the word truth, I think it SHOULD be what all people seek to the core of their beings. But instead, the mass population, do not seek the truth. They seek comfort, they seek ideas that solidify/re-inforce their internal beliefs, hearing otherwise is merely wrong, even if they can't explain it away logically.
<br>
People seek comfort and not the truth. This can be observed with the recent political movements in America.
<br>
<br>
<h3>Self-reflection and potential for manipulation</h3>
I, myself am guilty of falling into comfort. But perhaps, I or the general person are not to blame. There are agendas being pushed down our necks constantly. There are algorithms deciding for us what would provide their platforms the most click through rates or watch times. 
<br>
What catchy title can be placed here to direct attention, either through manipulating a person's emotions of anger, passion or boredom.
<br>
<br>
<h3>Truth in the modern age</h3>
I am finding that the comfortable is all you are going to get, unless you revel in discomfort. With the advent of the internet and communication, you can easily find communities that echo your internal beliefs and feed you comfortability. So truth in the modern age can be difficult to locate.
<br>
<br>
<h3>Truth - Hurt and/or help</h3>
But the truth DOES regularly in fact hurt. The truth can destroy after infidelity for instance.

But there are healing properties as well, hiding the truth can be straining and revealing it can be a load off ones shoulders to share the load with another.

Ultimately, I think comfort is weakness. A person who strives to better themself mustn't become complacent, a person who lives for what is right and true.
<br>
<br>
<h3>Rules</h3>
I think to alleviate the comfortable:
<br>
<ul>
	<li>Stay away from echo chambers online and in-person (NO CULTS or CULTS OF PERSONALITIES)</li>
	<li>DO NOT surround yourself with yes men, or people that will agree with you blindly. Recognise when you are in a position of power and to not misuse it.</li>
	<li>Have people around you that challenge you in a manner that is helpful and constructive and not childish or cruel</li>
	<li>It is okay to still be comfortable but within reason</li>
	<li>You are human, with your ingrained beliefs and bias. Recognise these and be aware</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h3>Thought exercises</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Do you think humanity as a whole seeks truth or do you think they seek comfort? Why do you think this?</li>
	<li>What does comfort vs truth mean to you?</li>
</ul>
A final rule and a neat conclusion be an objective third party in situations, even if those situations pertain to yourself.
