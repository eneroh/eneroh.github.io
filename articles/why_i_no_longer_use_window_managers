Windows managers vs desktop environments

Typically window managers are lightweight, very efficient and extremely customisable ways to navigate an operating system. However, they are incomplete. Everything must be done via terminal or by broken/inconsistent/weird looking gui menus that do not match what style you are trying to configure.

It's this inconsistency that you spend so much time to resolve, all in hopes to make your window manager experience more enjoyable. But to access specific things, you have to ultimately use the desktop environment version.

Pavucontrol for instance is a big one, sound is big in every os.
Networking is also very important and you'll need to use nm-tui or an equivalent which even though you aren't trapped in a desktop environment. It still kind of sucks.

So why settle for weird viewing options, why settle for spending so much time only to have inconsistencies plague your experience?

I've reverted back to gnome. Even though window managers are really cool, configurable and lightweight. The desktop experience just isn't the same as a fully-fledged desktop environment, due to inconsistent menus/gui elements.

Unfortunately with how windows manager are created this is something you'll never be able to escape.
